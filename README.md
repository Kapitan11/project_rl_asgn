# Project RL Assignment

## Group 15

Michal Butkiewicz, Sunny Soni, Andrzej Szczepura

## Steps for setting up the environment :

For anaconda, use the command : conda env create -f environment.yml
in the main directory.

For vanilla python virtual environment or installation, you can also use : pip install -r requirements.txt

## File Descriptions :

Agent_Final.py : contains our self designed gym environment
preprocess.py : contains code for preprocessing the xlsx files for our environment
DDQN_Agent.py : contains the DDQN based RL agent
ddqn_train.py : contains code for training and validating our DDQN agent on our custom environment
tabular_qlearning.py : contains the Tabular Qlearning based RL agent as well as code for training and testing the models
random_baseline.py : code for testing our agent with random actions on validation set

exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb : EDA python notebooks
Plots.ipynb : Python notebooks with the code used for plotting graphs for our report
ddqn_plot_v_values.py : code for plotting the v-value plots

## Experiments :

In all the experiment files, you can change the mode variable to 'train' to train your own models using the custom agent.

### For DDQN :

1. Use ddqn_train.py for training/validation.
2. Look for parameters to configure using the class definition in DDQN_Agent.py.

### For Tabular :

1. Use tabular_qlearning.py for training and validation.

### Random baseline :

1. Use random_baseline.py for console output.

## Validation on standard environment :

main.py makes use of our pretrained ddqn agent using the basic set to work on the validation set provided in validate.xlsx.
