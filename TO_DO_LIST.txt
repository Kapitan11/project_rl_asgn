1. Implement DQN pipeline.

2. Research and play with day trading features

3. Reward shaping

4. Hyperparameter optimisation (Discount Factor, Learning Rate, Epsilon, Replay Buffer Length, More if we can think...)

5. Overleaf report.

- Cite the sources for market analysis and stuff like articles, but not too much
- Focus on analysis of the results and analysis, only show small tables of results
- Go deep on discussion about results like why somethings work better, why not
- Also put a little bit of code snippets of algos and stuff in appendix, not needed in the main report
- Focus on conceptual ideas more than implementation and coding part

6. Presentation.

7. Clean up this fucking code directory in the end. Also update readmes and steps for execution.

-------------------------

Number of suggested baselines until now :

1. Random baseline

2. Tabular :

i Low number of features (not including engineered)
ii High number of features (including engineered ones)

3. Deep Q Learning :

i Low number of features (not including engineered)
ii High number of features (including engineered ones)
